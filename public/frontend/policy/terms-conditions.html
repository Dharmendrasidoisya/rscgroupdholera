	          <h5>IndianTradeBird Infringement Verification (IIV) - Reporting Listing Violations</h5>
	          <p>IndianTradeBird has put in place IndianTradeBird Infringement Verification process so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in IndianTradeBird's interest to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.</p>
			<p>If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see IndianTradeBird's IIV. Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products or listings through IIV. If you are not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us.
			If your listing was removed through IIV, and you believe that your listing was removed in error, please contact us.</p>
			<p>IndianTradeBird does not and cannot verify that Sellers have the right or ability to sell or distribute their listed products. However, IndianTradeBird is committed to removing infringing or unlicensed products once an authorized representative of the rights owner properly reports them to IndianTradeBird.</p>
<p>IIV works to ensure that item listings do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. IIV participants have the ability to identify and request removal of allegedly infringing products and materials.</p>
<p>Any person or company who holds intellectual property rights (such as a copyright, trademark or patent) which may be infringed upon by products listed on RSC Group Dholera is encouraged to become a IIV member.</p>
<p>Program membership entitles you (Verified Rights Owner) to the following benefits:<br/>
Rapid response by IndianTradeBird in ending listings reported by you (as the Verified Rights Owner) as allegedly infringing<br/>
Dedicated priority email queues for reporting alleged infringements<br/>
The ability to obtain identifying information about IndianTradeBird's users'</p>
